The principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral
as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. A rigorous mathematical definition of the integral was given by Bernhard Riemann. It is based on
a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century,
more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed has been
generalised. A line integral is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration [a, b] is replaced by a certain curve connecting 
two points on the plane or in the space. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in the three-dimensional space.
